Interdisciplinary research in Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and Economics.
### Collaborations
I am actively collaborating with the [United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)](https://unece.org) on Conformal Prediction and Inference for reliable uncertainty quantification when dealing with predictions from large black-box machine learning models.

I am part of [Eurostat CROS (Collaboration in Research and Methodology for Official Statistics)](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/)Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Official Statistics (AIML4OS) task force on Large Language Models, studying ways to integrate LLMs in statistical processes.

I am also working with [Sapienza University of Rome](https://uniroma1.it) to study Conformal Prediction and Prediction-powered inference for integrating machine learning in Official Statistics.

I actively work with [University of Perugia](https://www.unipg.it/en/) to study speech transcriptions from Central Bankers through natural language processing techniques, and assessing their impact on macroeconomic variables.
